##Hasan Durmaz’s Security Portfolio 💻 🔐 🛡️

I am a cybersecurity professional with a strong focus on defensive security, vulnerability management, and security operations. I enjoy breaking down complex security problems, prioritizing real risk, and building practical solutions that improve an organization’s security posture. My goal is to contribute to and eventually lead blue team initiatives that defend against modern threats in cloud and enterprise environments.

I hold a B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance and have earned multiple industry certifications, including CompTIA Security+, CySA+, PenTest+, Network+, and AZ-900. I have hands-on experience conducting vulnerability assessments, analyzing CVEs, and supporting remediation efforts across endpoints and cloud resources.

In my professional and project experience, I have worked with vulnerability scanning, risk prioritization, and remediation tracking, often combining technical analysis with clear communication to ensure security findings translate into action. I also leverage scripting and automation to reduce repetitive tasks and improve response time, helping teams focus on high-impact security work.

My technical skill set includes Endpoint Security, Vulnerability & Patch Management, Threat Detection, Log Analysis, and Cloud Security Fundamentals. I am comfortable working with frameworks and standards such as NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP Top 10, and CVSS, and I regularly apply them to real-world scenarios.

I value collaboration and transparency and work best in environments where security is aligned with business objectives. I take pride in being dependable, detail-oriented, and continuously curious—always learning new tools and techniques to stay ahead of evolving threats.

I am always open to connecting with security professionals, mentors, and teams who are passionate about building resilient and secure systems.
