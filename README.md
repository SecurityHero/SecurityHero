# Hasan Durmaz’s Portfolio 💻 📂 💭

I thrive on solving complex security challenges and aspire to contribute to and eventually lead blue team initiatives that protect organizations from sophisticated cyber threats. Known for being adaptable and detail-oriented, I blend diverse skills and tools to identify, prioritize, and remediate security risks, helping strengthen the overall security posture of the environments I work in.

I hold a **B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance from Western Governors University (WGU)** and have completed all certifications required for graduation, including **CompTIA Security+**, **PenTest+**, **Network+**, and **ITIL 4**. Through hands-on labs and real-world projects, I have developed a strong foundation in vulnerability management and security operations.

Through my academic and project experience, I have conducted vulnerability scans, analyzed and prioritized findings using CVSS, and supported remediation efforts through clear documentation and automation. I regularly leverage scripting with **PowerShell and BASH** to streamline remediation tasks and reduce operational overhead.

My technical proficiencies include **Endpoint Detection and Response**, **CVE/CWE Management**, **CVSS Scoring**, **OWASP Top 10**, **PowerShell and BASH scripting**, **firewall/NSG configuration**, and working within security frameworks such as **NIST**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **PCI-DSS**. I have hands-on experience using tools such as **Tenable**, **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**, and **Microsoft Sentinel**, where I utilize **KQL** to build dashboards and support threat hunting activities.

I excel in collaborative environments and value clear communication, transparency, and alignment between security objectives and business needs. I am known for being reliable, analytical, and proactive, with a strong desire to continuously learn and improve as a security professional.

I am eager to connect with professionals and organizations seeking to strengthen their security posture. Let’s collaborate to protect and defend digital assets against today’s and tomorrow’s cyber threats.
